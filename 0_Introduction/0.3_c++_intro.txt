0: Preface 
- amalgamates sections 0.3 - 0.5 

1. History 
- C was the progamming lang b4 c++ 
- C was developed by Dennis Ritchie 
- C++ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension to c
- ISO committee = international standard for organization
- C nd C++'s underlying philo: 
    * trust the programmer 

2. C++ Queries  
- what is C++ used 4?:
    * video games 
    * real-time systems 
    * finances 
    * office suite 
    * embedded software 
    * AI 
- how r c++ programs developed? 
    a) define problem to solve 
    b) contrive a logical and methodical solution 
    c) type a prog that implements the solution 
    d) compile the program 
    e) link object files 
    f) test the program 
    g) debug
    h) repeat d-g 

3. Key Terms Related to Development of C++ Prog 
- linker = compiles all object files nd produces a desired 
output file
- linking = process of a linker running 
- library files = collections of precompiled code for reuse
- object file = an intermediate file named .o or .obj 

4. Libraries 
- c++ standard library 
- optional to link third party libraries 
- possible to link nd cre8 ur own; discussed in appendix 

5. Building 
- building = the process of converting source code files 
into an executable 
- build (n) = a specific executable file produced as the
result of building
- build automation tools (e.g., make, build2)

6. Testing and IDEs
- testing = the process of assessing whether ur software
functions as expected 
debugging = identifying nd correcting programming errors
- IDEs (integrated development environment)
r software programs that collectively include:
    * editors
    * compiler 
    * linker 
    * debugger 
- acknowledge: 
    * 0.6 is ab IDEs nd selecting one 2 use, for
    own reasons i decided to not use one, instead opting for 
	notepad++ nd terminal usage
