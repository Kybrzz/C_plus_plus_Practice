1. Configuring Compiler: Build Configs
- build config/build target = a collection of project settings 
that determines how ur IDE will build ur project
- debug config
- release config = 4 releasing ur program to public

2. Configuring Compiler: Compiler Extensions
-  compiler extensions = compiler-specific behaviors
- acknowledge: we will disable them to ensure ur 
coding practices nd subsequent programs remain 
compliant w/ C++ standards, nd will work on any system 

3. Configuring Compiler: Warning nd Error Lvls 
- ill-formed = committing action that violates rules of lang
- diagnostic msg/diagnostic = an indic8r the compiller emits
when an issue is encountered 
- diagnostic error/compilation error/compiler errors = 
diagnostic errors generated by the compiler 
- diagnostic warning/warning = compiler has decided 
not to halt compilation; issue is ignored 
- acknowledge: we will increase warning lvls, since 
compilers only generate warnings ab the most serious
issues; we will request our compiler to be more 
assertive w/ providing warnings as a 'best practice'
to aid in identifying programming mistakes
    * we will also treat warnings as errors

4. Configuring Compiler: Selecting a Lang Standard 
- look @ the standards if necessary 
-
