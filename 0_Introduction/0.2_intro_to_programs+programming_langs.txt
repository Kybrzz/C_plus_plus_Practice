1. Skim of Key Terms
- computer program
- programming language 
- programming 
- exectuing 
- launch/run/execute 
- hardware 
- components of hardware: 
    * CPU 
    * memory 
    * interactive devices 
    * storage devices
- software 
- platform 
- portable = a program that is easily transferred from one 
platform to another 
- porting = the act of modifying a program intending it to
be ran on a diff platform 

2. Skim of Programming Language Key Terms 
- machine language/machine code 
- instruction set = the exhaustive set of machine lang 
instruction that a particular CPU can comprehend 
- binary digit/bit = an indy 1 or 0 
- CPU family 
- assembly language/assembly = human-readable programming lang
- assembler = translation from assembly to machine 
- compiler = a program(s) that reads source code nd transl8s
it to a low-level lang 
- executable file 
interpreter = a program that directly executes source code
instructions w/o requiring compilation first 
- cross-platform 

3. Key Takeaways
- CPUs do not understand assembly, so assembly programs must
be transl8ed into machine lang b4 execution is possible 

4. Low v. High-Level Langs
- ll: 
    * e.g., machine langs, assembly langs 
    * tailored to the instruction set program is ran on 
    * downsides: 
        a) not portable; unmotile 
        b) diff to understand 
        c) diff to type 
    * benefits:
        a) quick 
- hl: 
    * e.g., c++, python 
    * downsides: 
        a) must be transl8d b4 able to be run via compiler 
        or interpreter 
    * benefits: 
        a) stores instructions in random memory 
        b) does not require programmers to know exhaustively
        about the platform it will be written on 
        c) ez to type nd comprehend
        d) include additional capabilities facilitating more
        efficient programming tasks (e.g., loops) 
- on c++
    * now described as a mid-level lang, when juxtaposed w/ 
    newer programming langs (e.g. scripting langs) 

5. Tutorial Structure 
a) rule: instructions mandated by lang - n-n
b) best practice: recommended or idiomatic 
c) warning: do not do; - n-n
