/* Comments

===1.2 Comments===

- comment = programmer-readable memo that is inserted directly into the source code of a program
- comments r ignored by the compiler nd r 4 programmer/user use exclusively
- two diff types of comments: "single-line" nd "multi-line"
- single line comments = //
- multi-line comments = rf above
- proper use of comments:
    a) describe purpose (for what code does)
    b) describe methodology (for code accomplishing its goal)
    c) describe reason (for code doing some 'thing')
- best comment practices:
    * liberally comment as if ur describing it to some1 who has no clue what code does
    *
