===1.1: Statements nd Program Structure===

1. introduction 
- myriad of c++ topics to introduce, will only introduce topics
@ superifical level 

2. statements 
- computer program: a sequence of instructions that direct a comp
what to do 
- statement: a type of instruction that causes a program to execute
some action 
- acknowledge: 
    * nearly all statements in c++ end in a semicolon 
- types of statements:
    a) declaration (statements)
    b) jump
    c) expression 
    d) compound 
    e) selection/conditional 
    f) iteration/loop
    g) try blocks 

3. functions 
- statements r often grouped into units termed 'functions' (func(s)) 
- func = a collection of statments that r exectued sequentially
- acknowledge:
    * all(?) c++ programs must have a special func named "main"
    * when "main" is executed, the statements inside it r sequentially performed
    * funcs r often titled correlating to a particular task/action
    * common nomenclature is to append a pair of parenthesis
    to the end of the func's name (e.g., main()) 
        a) purpose is to differentiate it from other similar obj names
- identifier = name of a function 

4. characters (chars) nd text 
- char = a written symbol or mark (e.g., 1, d, .) 
- string = a sequence of chars 
- control char = chars w/ no displayable output but still
producing an effect (e.g., tab, space)
