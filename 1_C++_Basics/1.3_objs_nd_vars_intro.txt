===1.3: Intro to Objects nd Variables===

1. Random Access Memory
- RAM/Random Access Memory
    * where the os loads the program (rf run time step 6) 

2. Objects nd Variables
- in c++, direct memory access is discouraged; memory is insterad accessed indirectly via an 'object'
- object = a region of storage that contains a value and possess associated properties 
- variable = an obj w/ a name
- every var contains:
    * identifier
    * type
    * value 
    * + more (not pertinent 2 this lesson) 
- allocaiton = the process of reserving storage for an obj's use 

3. Data Types 
- data type = determines what kind of value an obj will store 
- best practice:
    * avoid defining multiple variables of the same type in a single statement,
    even tho the lang permits u to do so 
    * instead, use a single-line comment w/ each var defined in a seperate statement 

4. Quiz
a) what is data?
    * encoded info
b) what is a value?
    * the stored property of a var or obj THAT CAN BE REPRESENTED AS DATA
3) what is an obj? 
    * a region of storage that contains a value nd possesses associated properties
4) what is a var? 
    * a named object, containing an identifier, type, nd value 
5) what is an identifier? 
    * the name that a var is accessed by
6) what is a data type used for? 
    * to determine nd specify the type of value an obj stores
7) what is an int? 
    * a whole number not containing any decimal or fraction components
